title: Trying a new keyboard layout
---

I am trying the <a href="http://colemak.com/">Colemak</a> keyboard layout because it seems to be a lot smarter than qwerty. Requirements of keyboards have moved on since the days of typrewriters... <br /><br />Colemak seems to be a good candidate because it minimises the number of changed keys to make it easier to switch between the ubiquitous qwerty and Colemak.<br /><br />To test my current speeds as a benchmark, I used an <a href="http://www.typeonline.co.uk/typingspeed.php">online speed test</a>.<br /><br />On 2 February, 2010, My qwerty speed was 61 WPM, and my Colemak speed was 9 WPM, while using the on-screen keyboard as a guide.<br /><br />On 3 February, 2010, my Colemak speed was 10 WPM, without looking at the keys.<br /><br />On 7 February, 2010, my Colemak speed was 15 WPM.<br /><br />On 8 February, 2010, my Colemak speed was 19 WPM (with one mistake: missing the second 'e' of Hernecastle).
