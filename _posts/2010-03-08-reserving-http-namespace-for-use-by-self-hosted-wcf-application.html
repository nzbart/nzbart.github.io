title: Reserving HTTP namespace for use by self-hosted WCF application
---

I ran into the following error while creating a WCF application that is not hosted in IIS:<br /><br /><blockquote>HTTP could not register URL http://+:8080/Logging/. Your process does not have access rights to this namespace (see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=70353 for details).</blockquote><br />The solution on Vista is to reserve the namespace for the user that wants to bind to this URI, which must be done as an administrator:<br /><br /><i>netsh http add urlacl url={url} user={user\domain}</i><br /><br />See <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733768.aspx">MSDN</a> for more detail, and don't forget that you will need to configure your firewall if you want this address to be externally visible.
