title: ETW in .NET

After searching for a while, I found the classes for using Event Tracing for Windows in .NET. They are in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.eventing.aspx">System.Diagnostics.Eventing</a> namespace.<br /><br />Note that these classes only work on Vista and Server 2008 (and newer).
