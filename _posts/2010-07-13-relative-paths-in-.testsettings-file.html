title: Relative paths in .testsettings file
---

To configure relative code coverage paths in the .testsettings file, you will need to manually edit the xml file. First configure your coverage DLLs using the UI, then open the .testsettings file in a text editor, or in VS using the VS text editor.<br /><br />Edit the absolute paths to be relative to the location of your testsettings file, and use the %outdir% macro instead of bin\Debug:<br /><em>..\..\Utilities\%outdir%\Utilities.dll</em>
