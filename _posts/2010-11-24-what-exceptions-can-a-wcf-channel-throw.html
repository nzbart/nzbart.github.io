title: What exceptions can a WCF channel throw?
---

It seems that expected exceptions from a WCF channel include:<br /><br /><ul><li>TimeoutException</li><li>CommunicationException - FaultException, FaultException<T>, EndpointNotFoundException etc.</li></ul><br /><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa354510.aspx">MSDN describes the exceptions that are caused by communication errors</a>.<br /><br />Also from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.communicationexception.aspx">MSDN</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>When implementing custom channels and binding elements, it is strongly recommended that your components throw only System.TimeoutException or CommunicationException-derived objects. In the case where your components throw a recoverable exception that is specific to the component, wrap that exception inside a CommunicationException object.</blockquote><br />MSDN also describes how to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms733721.aspx">specify and handle faults in WCF contracts and services</a>.
