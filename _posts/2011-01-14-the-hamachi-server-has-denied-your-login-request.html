title: The Hamachi server has denied your login request
---

I ran into this problem after upgrading an older version of <a href="https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi2/download.aspx">Hamachi</a>:<br /><br /><pre>The Hamachi server has denied your login request.</pre><br /> <br/><hr/><h3>Simple Solution</h3><p>This page is very popular, so I wrote an application that will reset the Hamachi configuration. The application is the simplest solution, but the steps below do the same job. <a href="https://bitbucket.org/bartj/hamachireset/downloads/HamachiReset.exe" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','Download','HamachiReset',this.href]);"><strong>Download the application here</strong></a> (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/bartj/hamachireset">source is on BitBucket</a>).</p>  <p>You may need to restart your computer after running this program. <em><s>Please let me know in the comments below whether the application fixes your problem.</s>It looks like this program does not work on all operating systems and fix this error for all people. Your mileage may vary - feel free to contribute to the source code with your own situation.</em></p><hr/><br/><br/> The way I solved this problem was to delete the Hamachi configuration files. <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645">Procmon</a> was able to locate the configuration folders:<br /><ul><li>Depending on your system, one of: <pre>%WinDir%\System32\Config\SystemProfile\AppData\Local\LogMeIn Hamachi</pre><pre>%USERPROFILE%\..\LocalService\Local Settings\Application Data\LogMeIn Hamachi</pre></li><li>And: <pre>%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application Data\LogMeIn Hamachi</pre></li></ul>Below are steps you could use to clear the corrupted configuration on Windows. <br /><ol><li><strong>Start an elevated command prompt.</strong> In Windows 7 and Vista, press the Windows key or click on the Start menu, then type <strong>cmd</strong> into the text field at the bottom of the Start menu. Right click on the <i>cmd</i> icon at the top of the Start menu and click <i>Run as administrator</i> - you will need to either enter an administrator password or accept the dialog that pops up next. If you do this correctly, a black window called the command prompt will pop up.</li><li><strong>Copy this command line.</strong> Double click the command below to select it, and then press Ctrl+C or right click and select Copy to copy the command into the clipboard of your computer. <pre class="brush:plain">cmd /c rd /s/q "%USERPROFILE%\..\LocalService\Local Settings\Application Data\LogMeIn Hamachi" &amp; rd /s/q "%USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application Data\LogMeIn Hamachi" &amp; rd /s/q "%WinDir%\System32\Config\SystemProfile\AppData\Local\LogMeIn Hamachi"</pre></li><li><strong>Run the command line.</strong> Paste the command into the black window and hit enter to run it. It should reset your Hamachi configuration files and fix the problem.</li></ol><br />Please let me know by commenting below if this works or not for your particular situation, along with the version of Hamachi you are running if you know it.
