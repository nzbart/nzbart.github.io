title: Setting the current culture of a website
---

Rather than relying on the settings of the server, it can be prudent to set the current culture of your ASP.NET application using the following setting:<br /><br /><br /><pre class="brush:xml">  ...<br />  &lt;system.web><br />    ...<br />    &lt;globalization culture="en-NZ" uiCulture="en-NZ" /><br />    ...<br />  &lt;/system.web><br /></pre>
