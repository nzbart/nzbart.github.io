title: Installing ReSharper 6 causes several error dialogs
---

I recently installed ReSharper 6 (6.0.2202.688) into Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 and was greeted with some error dialogs:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DwfigCbO5kg/ThAgEIOPmsI/AAAAAAAAAII/nMTp-xwqiuw/s1600/Error1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DwfigCbO5kg/ThAgEIOPmsI/AAAAAAAAAII/nMTp-xwqiuw/s1600/Error1.png"  alt="The 'RadLangSvc.Package, RadLangSvc.VS, Version=10.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89845dcd8080cc91' package did not load correctly. The problem may have been caused by a configuration change or by the installation of another extension. You can get more information by running the application together with the /log parameter on the command line, and then examining the file 'C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application Data\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\ActivityLog.xml'."/></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6zwJudzSi0s/ThAgISli0JI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/w60m9ekLr9M/s1600/Error2.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6zwJudzSi0s/ThAgISli0JI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/w60m9ekLr9M/s1600/Error2.png" alt="The 'Language Package' package did not load correctly. The problem may have been caused by a configuration change or by the installation of another extension. You can get more information by running the application together with the /log parameter on the command line, and then examining the file 'C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\Application Data\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\ActivityLog.xml'." /></a></div><br />It looks as though <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/532121/tons-of-package-did-not-load-correctly-errors">this is a known issue</a>, caused by a conflict between some plugins, Visual Studio 2010, and SQL Server 2008 R2.<br /><br />The solution for me was to install <i>\WCU\DAC\DACProjectSystemSetup_enu.msi</i> from the Visual Studio 2010 installation media.
