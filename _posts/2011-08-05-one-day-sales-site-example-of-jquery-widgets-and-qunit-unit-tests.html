title: One day sales site - example of jQuery widgets and QUnit unit tests
---

I have made a small site that uses some Javascript features such as drag and drop so that I could try writing QUnit unit tests. The tests were refreshingly easy to write, including testing things such as dragging and dropping by simulating mouse clicks.<br /><br />The site allows users to view <a href="http://www.nzonedaysales.info">popular one-day sale sites in New Zealand</a>, and the tests can be found <a href="http://www.nzonedaysales.info/Tests/Main.html">here</a>.
