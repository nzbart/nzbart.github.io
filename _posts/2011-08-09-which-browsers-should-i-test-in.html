title: Which browsers should I test in?
---

I needed to answer the question "Which browsers should I test in?", but was frustrated by how difficult this was to answer in Google Analytics. After months of frustration and not being able to easily give solid figures from our websites, I knocked up a one-page site that aggregates the Analytics data of the logged in user and allows them to play around with various scenarios to decide which browsers to test in. Most importantly, this <i>uses data from the target market</i>, not from a generic or randomised sites.<br /><br />Please note that this site uses the Google GData JavaScript API, so none of your Analytics data is sent to my servers.<br /><br />The site is here: <br /><a href="http://browsertest.info">browsertest.info</a>
