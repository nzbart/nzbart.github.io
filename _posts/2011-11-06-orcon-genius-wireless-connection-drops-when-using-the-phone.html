title: Orcon Genius wireless connection drops when using the phone
---

I am using the <a href="http://www.orcon.net.nz/">Orcon</a> Genius, and so far have been pretty happy with the reduced telephone bill and features of the Genius. <br /><br />However, I did run into an unusual problem where the wireless connection to my laptop would cut out whenever I answered an incoming call on the handset; surprisingly, outgoing calls did not affect the wireless connection.<br /><br />After troubleshooting with the (very friendly) Orcon technician, the solution turned out to be to change the wireless channel setting from "Auto" to "6".  <br /><br />To do this, I:<br /><br /><ol><li>Pointed my browser at&nbsp;<a href="http://10.1.1.1/">http://10.1.1.1</a>.</li><li>Entered my password (I believe the default is 'admin', but don't forget to change it) to log in.</li><li>Clicked on "2. Set up my wireless".</li><li>Set the drop down box to the right of "Channel" to 6.</li><li>Clicked "Save settings".</li></ol><br />Problem solved!
