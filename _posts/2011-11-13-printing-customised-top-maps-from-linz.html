title: Printing customised top maps from LINZ
---

Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) has topographical maps that cover New Zealand available for free download.<br /><br />I am planning a trip over the Tongariro Crossing, and wanted to print a topo map that covers the walk. Unfortunately, as so often happens, the walk traverses two maps. To solve this problem, I decided to merge two maps and then print only the appropriate part of the map.<br /><br />To merge the maps, the simplest method was to download the two maps in GeoTiff format and merge them using the GDAL tools, which are compiled by Frank Warmerdam into a <a href="http://fwtools.maptools.org/">handy Windows package</a>:<br /><br /><pre><a href="http://www.gdal.org/gdal_merge.html">gdal_merge</a> -v -q -o merged.tif -of GTiff <a href="http://topo.linz.govt.nz/Topo50_raster_images/GeoTIFFTopo50/BH34_GeoTifv1-01.tif">BH34_GeoTifv1-01.tif</a> <a href="http://topo.linz.govt.nz/Topo50_raster_images/GeoTIFFTopo50/BH35_GeoTif_1-00.tif">BH35_GeoTif_1-00.tif</a></pre><br />The next step was to crop the appropriate part of the map so that the scale was preserved when I printed it on A3 paper. A key point to note is that the original LINZ GeoTiff is set to 300 DPI or 118.11 pixels/cm. In the drawing tool I used (<a href="http://www.getpaint.net/">Paint.NET</a>), I was able to set the DPI to 300 and then set a crop area of 42 x 29.7 cm to select the area I wanted. Bear in mind that many printers are not able to print onto the full paper size, so a smaller area may be required to preserve the scale.<br/><br/>Note that the -v -q arguments were required for the version of FWTools that I downloaded due to a <a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3354">known issue</a> in GDAL.
