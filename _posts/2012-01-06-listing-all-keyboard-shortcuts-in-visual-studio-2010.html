title: Listing all keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio 2010
---

<p>The NuGet package manager for Visual Studio comes with a hidden gem - a <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console">PowerShell console called Package Manager Console</a>. This console not only allows developers to install and configure NuGet packages, but also has a useful variable called $dte, which is the Visual Studio automation COM object.</p> <p>To demonstrate the usefulness of this feature, I thought it would be interesting to list all the keyboard shortcuts that I currently had bound. To do this, I ran the following PowerShell one-liner:</p> <pre class="brush:ps"><br />$dte.Commands | ? { $_.Bindings.length -ne 0 -and $_.name.length -ne 0 } | sort Name | select Name, Bindings | % { $b = $_.Name; $_.Bindings | % { $_ -match '(.*)::(.*)' | out-null; new-object psobject -Property @{ Name = $b; Context = $Matches[1]; Key = $Matches[2]} } } | sort Context, Name, Key | select Context, Name, Key | ft -AutoSize<br /></pre> Of course, if you want to grab this information and format it for better printing, just replace the last step in the pipeline (<code>ft -AutoSize</code>) with <code>ConvertTo-Csv | clip</code>. This will copy all your shortcuts into the clipboard in CSV format, and you can paste them into Excel for better formatting and printing.
