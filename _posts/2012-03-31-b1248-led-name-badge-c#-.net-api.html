title: B1248 LED Name Badge C# / .NET API
---

<p>I am working on an open source API for the B1248 LED name badge that I got from <a href="http://codemania.co.nz/">CodeMania in Auckland, New Zealand</a>. So far, it is possible to send any ASCII message to the device in the first slot, so it is useful as a display attached to a computer. </p> <p>The code is not complete and I am definitely open to contributions!!</p> <p>Find the code at BitBucket: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/bartj/led">https://bitbucket.org/bartj/led</a></p>
