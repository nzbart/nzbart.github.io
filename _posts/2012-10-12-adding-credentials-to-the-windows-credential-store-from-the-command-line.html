Service users often do not have permission to start GUI applications, so the following tool can be used to store credentials that can be used to access a server, for example to copy a backup onto a remote file share.<br /><br /><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754243%28v=ws.10%29.aspx">cmdkey.exe</a><br /><br />The syntax to add credentials to the store is:<br /><br /><code>cmdkey /add:<i>targetname </i>/user:<i>username </i>/pass</code>
