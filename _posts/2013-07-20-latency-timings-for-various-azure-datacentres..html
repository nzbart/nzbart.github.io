title: Latency timings for various Azure datacentres.
---

I have published a tool that 'pings' various Azure datacentres around the world from your browser to see which have the lowest / highest latency. This obviously is most useful if most of your customers are in a single location, but I suspect that scenario is quite common. <br /><br /> The tool can be found at <a href="http://azureping.info/">http://azureping.info</a>.
