title: Missing b43/ucode5.fw and b43-open.ucode5.fw installing Debian
---

The solution to the missing b43/ucode5.fw and b43-open.ucode5.fw firmware files when installing Debian is to download firmware.tar.gz appropriate for your version of Debian (mine was http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/firmware/testing/20130826/) and copy it to a USB stick (mine was FAT32 formatted).
